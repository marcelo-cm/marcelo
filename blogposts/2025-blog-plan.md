# Designing ~~good~~ great Frontends That Scale

- Breaking down my directory structure (mimicking same structure across different folders, pit of success)
- Layers used to render NextJs pages (data-fetching, fallback, view)
- Hook patterns
- API directory structure for testing & organization
- Context & stores

# How My Definition of Success Defines my Optimal Policy

- I don't want a lot, I want enough—but enough in this day and age is quite a bit—and I want it today.
- Optimal policy is to do that which excites me most at any given moment. However, this only works because my goals, interests and work are closely aligned.
- I only do what I believe in, even if it's the harder decision
- Forming an advisory board

# The First Step is Figuring Out Your Story

- The best thing you can do for your personal & professional development is actually figuring out your story
- This informs who you want to talk to, and allows you to communicate your 'why' way better
- This informs who on who you are, and what you REALLY want—this makes everything you day far more intentional

# There is No Such Thing as Being Too Late

- Success is a function of time and effort `f(time,effort) = success`
  - Luck means nothing without both of these, and you don't need luck to succeed
- Timing doesn't matter—Using myself & Gonza as an example. Both started programming 12-18 months ago and have outpaced majority of CS graduates. Lejla as an example from her work before going to school again & her current success.
- Start before you're ready, and run as hard as you can.
