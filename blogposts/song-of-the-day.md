# Context

I consume a lot of music — genres from 90's neo-soul, rnb and hip-hop to japanese city pop, and spanish boleros. Every day is a different vibe, and I share this vibe with my loved ones. I love to chat music, so if you're curious about anything please shoot me an email: [marcechaman@gmail.com](mailto:marcechaman@gmail.com)

# Nov 2024

[Anti-glory — horsegirl](https://open.spotify.com/track/7xxeSJJ25Gu6dRBv8v7tKK) — Nice post-punk/indie vibe with great chords.

[Hello goodbye — Charlie XCX](https://open.spotify.com/track/7KA5C1c2byqgzCCgdo0nZR) — Simply just a good vibe.

[1 Thing — Amerie](https://open.spotify.com/track/1mnqraQ8oV8MX92rdOFLWW) — Went to a hip-hop club. Got me in the grove of mid 2000s female rap & r&b.

[Red Wine Supernova — Chappell Roan](https://open.spotify.com/track/7FOgcfdz9Nx5V9lCNXdBYv?si=d8a8c26f2c624b08) — A song that reminds me of my friend who showed me Chappell Roan before anyone really knew about her.

[トーキョーレギー — Masayoshi Takanaka](https://open.spotify.com/track/5floNyItopWZyB4IzKrJtW) — Japanese city pop from 1976. Making colours feel brighter and the sun shine harder.

[Something Cool (Mono) — June Christy](https://open.spotify.com/track/2mqjKGlSdJHdjCQHtOx6PD?si=31f3fc080e4348f5) — Stolen from the [North Hollywood](https://www.google.com/search?gs_ssp=eJzj4tVP1zc0zLJIzzUpKzQxYPSSzssvKslQyMjPyaksz89PUcjMyUlNT8xRSM4sAwA-8Q8i&q=north+hollywood+illegal+civ&oq=north+hollywood,+illegal&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) soundtrack. A beautiful song.

[Lemon Grass — MF DOOM](https://open.spotify.com/track/14hca4SHRBbKZkzPI0xXDL) — A Metal Fingers track that the world under appreciates, but every fan loves. Makes you feel like a kid playing outside as summer is ending, realizing you are growing up.

[High and Dry — Radiohead](https://open.spotify.com/track/2a1iMaoWQ5MnvLFBDv4qkf?si=6fef195fc7b44b9d) — Classic Radiohead.

[oh my love — FKA twigs](https://open.spotify.com/track/5dEJc0rHuTVxtl1xljDbRv?nd=1&dlsi=24ca26ee7d2242dc) — It's okay the first time you listen to it. It's amazing the 6th time.

[Thug Till It's Over — Cookin' Soul & Freddie Gibbs](https://open.spotify.com/track/41vSsnP46DpUZC0YoNyk3U) — Freddie Gibbs over soul-inspired samples is everything you could ask for on a long commute day.

[Pass It Pass It — Snoop Dogg](https://open.spotify.com/track/771aM9AY5YUx1OWl8tPJNG) — Amazing Pharrell produced song during Snoop's prime.

[I Want You — Marvin Gaye](https://open.spotify.com/track/2gmWJA9oF4GD2Vw5QoRqu1) — Smooth. Smooth. Smooth.

[Be — Common](https://open.spotify.com/album/2UuvBxV56QWWj2uviGS0up) — A rare moment in the SOTD tradition, where I can't choose a single song so I chose an album. Common's 'Be' is an incredible peace of work with meaningful lyrics regarding being present, being human, being flawed, and being curious.

# Oct 2024

[Popular Thug (feat. Nas) — The Neptunes](https://open.spotify.com/track/4wWHyQTz1QgmhIjyPm8bSk) — Incredible drums & keys. Nas and Kelis came through on their respective verses/hooks.

[love is embarrassing — Olivia Rodrigo](https://open.spotify.com/track/26QLJMK8G0M06sk7h7Fkse) — My favourite Olivia Rodrigo song, amazing drums & vocals.
