# Context

# The Process

1. Learn syntax

Using resources like [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) to learn the syntax to:

- HTML/CSS
- Typescript (or Javascript)
- Python
- Git/Terminal/Bash

2. Download your tools needed

- VSCode (or Cursor if you're an AI demon)
  - Get your VS Code extensions (ie. pets, intellisense for html, css/tailwind css, ts, npm, etc. , msft co-pilot, git graph, prettier, react code snippets)
- Git (checkout, pull, push, commit, create branch)
- Python with homebrew
- Node with nvm

2. Simultaneously do the following
   a. Build a react/node app. Use modern tech stack.
   b. learn basic data structures & algorithm
   c. read about what it means to write clean code

Using online tools (ie. chatgpt), build a react app from scratch. Read documentation about react (reading docs is how you learn fast). You can use Next.js as a good full-stack framework to start. I would suggest building an app with the following tools:

- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn
- Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- Node.js
- GoDaddy (if you want a domain)

Deploy on Vercel (front-end) and heroku (backend) if you don't have any other preferences. Design on Figma prior to building it out. Goal here: Learn how to consider different decisions about your project before building it. Learn to translate design to code. Learn to think about your product's flow before you build it out (prevents you from having to rewrite/re-architect your product once it's in code).

THIS WILL NOT BE GOOD. IT WILL PROBABLY SUCK. YOUR GOAL IS TO TRY TO ACHIEVE SOMETHING COOL WITH YOUR CODE, NOT TO BUILD THE NEXT BIGGEST STARTUP.

- Make Third-party API calls (read docs to achieve this well) using axios or fetch.
- Use relationship data-bases with foreign keys.
- Build an authentication workflow with third party provider
- Build a CRUD API with your node backend
- Have modular code and appropriate file structures (link workman codebase as example, describe file structure philosophy)
- Create interfaces/types in ts

Do [Neetcode's roadmap](https://neetcode.io/) to learn your basic data structures and algorithm. The goal: Learn how to write efficient code, learn fundamental CS skills, and learn to organize your code well. This will help you work through logic when you're developing your full stack app.

Read Clean Code — A handbook of agile software craftsmanship (Robert C. Martin Series, 2008). Goal: What does it mean to write clean code. How to make your code legible. The importance of writing good code. Basic do-s and don't-s of writing code.

When in doubt about anything, literally chatgpt it.

3. Read about how to do things better

Build more stuff, and build it better.

- Database design (what is normalization, how does)
- React context & stores
- Re-rendering optimization w/ million.js
