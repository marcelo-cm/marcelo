Here's a loosely modified/improved version of the email that got me my first software engineering internship in Dec 2023. Before I had any real experience, besides (client) projects, this got me into the process at 12+ startups — unfortunately I completely failed most of their technical interviews, but that's besides the point.

**Subject:** [2 MIN STUDENT OUTREACH] Ambitious 19yo Interested in Software Internship

Hi [Recipient(s)],

> I'm Marcelo _(linked with LinkedIn profile)_—I’m a 19-year-old student studying Commerce. I’m a serial founder with experience scaling communities to **XX,XXX** people that generate **XX,XXX ARR**, and building full-stack products with exceptional user experiences. Currently, I lead Canada’s largest undergraduate AI organization, QMIND _(linked to website)_, and a national AI conference, CUCAI _(link to website)_. I want to build with you at [Company].

Last April, I abandoned the traditional Commerce path, and switched focus to software engineering – Since then, I've spent most of my days learning how to become a better product engineer. Since last April I've built two products:

- [Client Project Name] – AI-powered communication for dental clinics, enabling human-like conversations with missed-call leads to help offices capture **XXX,XXX+** in additional revenue annually.
- [Project Name] – A voice-journaling tool I co-founded with two Google PMs that reached **XXX** MAU. Presented at a **XXX-person** conference in SF, May 2023.

I’ve built these products using React, Next.js (TypeScript), Node, and Flask.

**What I want out of this experience is to build around a team just as obsessive as I am**, and be a sponge to the teaching & mentorship from more experienced engineers & designers on the team. I want to become the best product engineer I can be, and the best way for me to do that is to be around a strong team like yours.

If you have just 15 mins to call next week, I'd love to tell you why I think I deserve a spot on your team. I'm looking for Software Engineering internship (full-time, remote or IRL) roles for the Summer 2024, which can be subsidized through Riipen, or MITACS. Attached is my resume _(link to resume hosted on personal website server)_, please let me know if you have any questions.

Sincerely,

Marcelo

Here is a cold email that responded directly to a LinkedIn post where the founder outlined what they look for when hiring. I tried to create my own role, which failed, but I believe this is a good example that highlights my work well.

> Hi [Recipient(s)],

I'm Marcelo, a 20-year-old Commerce student from Queen's University (Canada) who is pursuing product & software. I saw your post for a PM Intern and wanted to reach out to tell you why I might be a good fit. I'm a self taught engineer and product designer, with a love for making beautiful and delightful software, and I believe I could be a good addition to your team.

**How I fit the description of an ideal candidate**
I'm currently the only intern at a $3M ARR construction tech startup based in SF (remote), working as a full stack software engineer on their web platform. During my current internship, **I work with and design APIs daily, and work directly with the VP of Engineering and CEO to make decisions about database design and scope for the features I work on.** I also own the QA process for every feature I develop. I write code and design every single day, because I believe consistency and obsession is the formula for success — proof can be seen on my Github _(link to github)_.

I started developing just 1 year ago and since then I've led design and development of multiple products that have touched thousands of monthly active users and seen thousands in MRR, and have conduct dozens of user interviews:

- I designed, developed and PMed, Workman, an accounting automation tool for builders. We're a platform fully integrated with Quickbooks and Gmail that automated data entry. ($X MRR)
- I built the entire design system for [Client Name], a [client description], and assisted in the entire apps UI/UX design (including 12 feature sets, and brand assets)
  - They're currently in the development process of implementation the new UI
- I have worked (as a designer, PM, or engineer) on 4+ more platforms and case studies that can be seen here _(link to personal website)_.
- I have spent the last 1.5 years managing Canada's largest organizations on AI, and representing my university in international case competitions. Recently my focus has become: **How can I become the best product builder possible?**

I'm looking to join your team as a Technical PM or Product Engineering intern. I would love to design and write code if it's what the business needs. I've attached my resume, and you can find more information about me on my LinkedIn or website. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Marcelo
