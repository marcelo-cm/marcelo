# Explanation

Over the past two years, I changed... a lot. However, the way I described myself, at it's core, never changed. Once life calmed down a little bit I had realized that I lost touch with all the parts of myself that I would describe myself as — I was no longer an artist the way I claimed to be. My definition of success prior to the rapid 8-month stretch I was on, was no longer the same as my definition of success today. This prompted a question for myself: "Who am I and how do I become that?"

I used to read and write a lot — it would help me understand complex technical topics because it would force me to boil them down in a way that non-technical people would understand. This same concept is what I intend to apply today to answer such a complex question. What this question really means is, what is the new way I can accurately describe myself, and how can I dedicate myself to authentically live that way (How can I be the most 'me' possible). The answer is hopefully something that can help me love who I am more strongly, because I'm not trying to be anyone else and I can block out the noise that makes me feel like I need to be somebody else.

# What is the right way to describe yourself?

Before diving into how I describe myself, I wanted to understand the best ways to clearly describe yourself to others. One situation in which we do this very often is job interviews. While the context will be different, examining the 'proper' way to describe yourself in an interview will in theory provide clarity towards what are important characteristics to cover during this task.

1. What are the 3 words that best describe you?†
2. How do other people describe you?\*
3. In your opinion, what are your most important traits?†
4. What words come to mind when you think about yourself?
5. What adjectives would you use to describe yourself?†
6. How would you describe your personality?
7. Describe yourself in one sentence.†
8. Summarize yourself in as few words as possible.†

Though it's for time & simplicity purpose, these questions demand concision†, some relatively objective measures\* by considering how _others_ would describe you. However, when considering how to answer these questions, more questions come to light. What is considered an 'important' trait? How _would_ others describe me? What dimensions of your personality are the most prominent ones, such that is 'defines' your personality?

To answer what important traits are, I took a look at the [Big 5 Personality Traits](https://www.thomas.co/resources/type/hr-guides/what-are-big-5-personality-traits) theory. Instead of diving into deeply flawed personality tests, I thought it'd be effective to assess my own intensity across the personality traits listed.

To answer how others would describe me, I just asked others to describe me.

To answer the questions about your personality, there is of course several personality tests. MBTI is most commonly used, but it's been proven to be [inacurrate](https://steemit.com/psychology/@saunter/5-reasons-why-mbti-sucks). There is another interesting personality assessment found in book _The Art of People_ called [The Enneagram Test](https://www.truity.com/test/enneagram-personality-test), which I decided to use as a base to begin the exploration to define the characteristics of my personality.

For the other questions, I thought it'd be effective to answer them all in order to provoke deeper thought.

# So how do I describe myself?

1. What are the 3 words that best describe you?†
   Adaptable, Passionate, Introspective

2. How do other people describe you?\*

   1. Adaptable, Leader, Analytical, Disciplined
   2. Dedicated, Builder, Go-getter
   3. Driven and vision-focused, pragmatic with people, disciplined & goal-oriented

3. In your opinion, what are your most important traits?†
   My ability for extreme focus & perseverance, agility to move on ideas, high degree of openness, high conscientiousness, average extroversion.
