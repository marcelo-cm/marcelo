    title: 'WHO I AM',
    description:
      "I am a 20 year old product designer & software engineer born in Lima, Peru, raised in Toronto. I grew up experimenting in different things, from fashion at 13-15, to marketing & design studio at 16, and then scaled a 50k+ community at 18, and ran Canada's largest undergrad organizations on AI at 19. \
         \n \n \
        I grew up immersed by Peruvian culture, with amazing food, and a mother who always pushed me to try things I’m bad at... and sent me to engineer summer camps against my will. My brother introduced me to the world of technology when the iPhone 3GS released, and he is my greatest influence.\
         \n \n \
        I love art, tech, community, and learning new things. I love making new friends. I love everything I do.",
