          A 2024 goal of mine is to code every single day. As a full stack
          engineer, I wanted to make sure I was sharpening both swords. While I
          do LeetCode often, I wanted to make sure I kept my front end game
          strong as well.
        </p>
        <p className="max-w-[700px] w-4/5">
          Below is a collection of small components as projects/experiments I've
          worked on to keep my product design and front end skills sharp.
